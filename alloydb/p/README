The function deletebackup.go is created and tested for GCP Function gen 2 and works in collaboration with PUB/SUB
The PUB?SUB topic message is a JSON with 5 parameters
project - project name
location - backups location
operation - "DELETE" or "LIST" - the latter can be used for tests
cluster - AlloyDB cluster name or "ALL" for all backups in the project
retention - retention in days, the backups older than the retention will be deleted 

Here is an example of a message to delete all backups of the test-alloydb-01 cluster in the sandbox project older than 107 days:
{ "project":"sandbox",  "location":"us-central1", "operation":"DELETE", "cluster":"test-alloydb-01", "retention":107}
To list backups 
{ "project":"sandbox",  "location":"us-central1", "operation":"DELETE", "cluster":"test-alloydb-01", "retention":107}
to create a new backup for a cluster
{ "project":"sandbox",  "location":"us-central1", "operation":"CREATE", "cluster":"test-alloydb-01", "retention":0}
